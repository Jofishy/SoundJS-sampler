                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>In this tutorial we will learn how to use the SoundJS library to manage sound files, and control their playback. The tutorial will cover creating a simple web application that could be used as a musical sampler, however, you can use the examples and topics covered here to make any type of application that you would like.</p>
                <p><a href="https://joshuasfisher.github.io/SoundJS-sampler/sampler.html">Here</a> is an example of what can be achieved with this tutorial.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="Set up" class="body section">
                <h3>Setting up for development</h3>
                <p>In order to start using SoundJS, we need to create a server which can host our webpage. To do this, I will be using NodeJS http-server from npm. You could use your own server setup, or learn more about <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/">npm</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server">http-server</a>.</p>
                <p>The first thing we need to do is create a folder/directory for our project. We will also a new html file in that directory named index.html. Here's the html that we will start with in the file.</p>
                <pre><code>
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;
        &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot;&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Sampler&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;div class="sampler"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;script src=&quot;https://code.createjs.com/1.0.0/soundjs.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
                </code></pre>
                <p>Notice the script tag near the end of the document. This is where we include the SoundJS library into our page, and its coming from the latest file hosted by CreateJS as of writing. You can go to <a href="https://code.createjs.com/">https://code.createjs.com/</a> to find the latest url to use in this tag.</p>
                <p>We have also added a div that will contain the buttons, and added a sampler class so that it can be referenced in the javascript</p>
                <p>Now to host this we can run the following command, which will install and run http-server from the current directory.</p>
                <code>npx http-server ./</code>
                <p>From here, navigating to <a href="http://localhost:8080/index.html">http://localhost:8080/index.html</a> will pull up the created page, which should just contain our header at this point.</p>
                <p>The last task for setting up the page is creating our own javascript file. To do this, create an empty file named sampler.js in the same directory, then add the following script tag to the end of the html file.</p>
                <pre><code>&lt;script src=&quot;/sampler.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
                <p>Now we can get started creating the sampler!</p>
            </div>
            <div id="Import Sounds" class="body section">
                <h3>Importing sounds into the page</h3>
                <p>The first thing that we need to do is to create a place where the sound files that will be played can be hosted. For this, I will continue to use http-server, and just create a subdirectory in the project folder with wav files that SoundJS can pull from.</p>
                <p>Now we can write some javascript that references this location.</p>
                <pre><code>
const filepath = "./audio/";
const sounds = [
    {name:"bass",src:"808.wav"},
    {name:"hat",src:"closed.wav"},
    {name:"snare",src:"snare.wav"}
]
                </code></pre>
                <p>This code defines the directory path that I created for the samples. It also creates an array that contains objects for the name of the sample, and the sample file name.</p>
                <p>Now we need to tell SoundJS to load these files into the browser, as well as what to do once they are loaded</p>
                <pre><code>
createjs.Sound.addEventListener("fileload", handleLoad);
createjs.Sound.registerSounds(sounds, filepath);
                </code></pre>
                <p>Here we add an event listener, which is called when each file is done loading. We also register the sounds to be loaded. Once this is done, SoundJS handles downloading and managing the files so we can reference them where ever we want.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="Handle Sounds" class="body section">
                <h3>Handling sounds using SoundJS</h3>
                <p>The next step is to create a the handleLoad function which is called for each file loaded. In this function, we need to create a button for the loaded file that can play the sound, and add an event listener that will play the sound.</p>
                <pre><code>
function handleLoad(event){
    const src = event.src;

    createPad().addEventListener("click", ()=>{
        playSound(src);
    });
}
                </code></pre>
                <p>Additionally, we called two more functions, createPad and playSound. createPad creates the html button which we add an event listener to. playSound is the function that actually plays the sound.</p>
                <pre><code>
function createPad(){
    const button = document.createElement("button");
    document.querySelector(".sampler").appendChild(button);

    return button;
}
                    
function playSound(src){
    return createjs.Sound.play(src);
}
                </code></pre>
                <p>The createPad function adds a new button element in the sampler div that we created on the html page and returns it so that we can add the listener to it. playSound uses SoundJS's play method to play the sound, using the source from the event for reference.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="Conclusion" class="body section">
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>That's it! You should now have a simple web page that can play sounds using the buttons on screen. From here you can use the same techneques to trigger sounds within a game, or add more improvements to make the website more musical. For example, on my version I tracked the playing sounds so they couldn't be playing more than one at a time, and added keyboard events to trigger the sounds as well.</p>
